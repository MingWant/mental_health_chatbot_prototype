University Mental Health Detailed Knowledge Base (English Version)
I. Core Principles & Self-Awareness
Mental Health is a Spectrum, Not Binary

Explanation: Mental health is not a simple state of "healthy" or "sick." It's a dynamic spectrum where everyone moves. Feeling stressed, anxious, or down is a universal human experience and does not mean you are "broken."

Positive Advice: Accept your emotional fluctuations as important signals from your body, not as enemies to be immediately eliminated.

Asking for Help is an Act of Strength

Explanation: Proactively seeking help requires immense courage and self-awareness. It shows you are taking charge of your well-being.

Positive Advice: View seeking help like seeing a dentist or a fitness trainer—it's maintenance for a crucial part of your health.

II. Detailed Application Scenarios & Solutions
Scenario 1: Academic Pressure Overload (e.g., Finals Week, Multiple Deadlines)
Immediate Coping Strategies:

Advanced Pomodoro Technique: Work for 25 mins, break for 5 mins. During the 5-minute break, DO NOT check your phone. Instead: breathe deeply, drink water, look out the window, do light stretches.

Task Deconstruction: Break a 10-page paper into: 1. Research (2 hrs) -> 2. Outline (30 mins) -> 3. Write intro (45 mins)... Checking off each micro-task provides continuous accomplishment.

"Brain Dump" Exercise: Set a 5-minute timer and write down every academic worry ("I'll fail," "I can't finish," "I'll disappoint my parents"). When time's up, rip up the paper or put it away. This ritual externalizes abstract anxieties.

Medium-Term Management Strategies:

Weekly Planning Session: Every Sunday night, spend 30 mins planning the week. Schedule all tasks and pre-schedule rest, exercise, and social time as non-negotiable appointments.

Form Study Groups: With 2-3 reliable peers to share notes, explain concepts, and hold each other accountable. Teaching others is one of the best ways to learn.

Resources to Seek:

Academic Tutoring Center: For writing support, math tutoring, etc.

Professor/TA Office Hours: Go prepared with specific questions.

Library Workshops: On time management, efficient reading, etc.

Scenario 2: Interrelationship Difficulties (e.g., Roommate Conflict, Loneliness, Feeling Left Out)
Communication Templates:

"I" Statement Formula: "I feel [emotion] when [specific event] because [reason]. I would like [clear request]."

Example: "I feel frustrated and unable to rest when you play games loudly with friends while I'm trying to sleep because I have an early class. I would like to discuss using headphones after 11 pm."

Active Listening: Paraphrase what the other person said. "So what I'm hearing is...", "It sounds like you felt... is that right?"

Social Expansion Strategies:

Interest-Based Clubs: Join clubs for hobbies (photography, hiking, gaming) rather than for pure socializing. The shared activity eases initial awkwardness.

Volunteering: Provides a sense of purpose and belonging, naturally connecting you with caring people.

Digital Tools: Join university Facebook groups, WhatsApp course chats to start conversations online before meeting offline.

Resources to Seek:

Resident Advisor (RA): Trained to mediate roommate conflicts.

Student Affairs Office: Hosts events for meeting people.

Counseling Center: Offers groups/workshops on social skills and anxiety.

Scenario 3: Future Uncertainty & Anxiety ("Is my major useful?" "What will I do after graduation?")
Self-Exploration Exercises:

Values Sorting: Find a "life values list" online (e.g., achievement, belonging, creativity, financial security, freedom, helping others). Pick your top 5 and rank them. This clarifies what truly matters to you.

Informational Interviews: Use LinkedIn or alumni networks to contact someone in a field of interest. Politely ask for 15-30 mins to learn about their job, required skills, and industry outlook.

Practical Action Steps:

Career Center: Get one-on-one counseling, resume reviews, mock interviews, attend career fairs.

Internships/Part-time Jobs: Provide invaluable real-world experience and help you rule options in or out.

Minors/Double Majors/Online Courses: Explore interests outside your major at low cost.

Positive Reframing:

Embrace "Trial and Error": View university as a safe lab. The goal isn't to find the one right answer, but to rule out what doesn't fit through experimentation.

Focus on Skills: Pay attention to transferable skills (communication, problem-solving, teamwork, data analysis) developed in any activity—they are valuable everywhere.

Scenario 4: Low Mood & Lack of Motivation (Losing interest in things, persistent fatigue)
Basics of Behavioral Activation:

Activity Monitoring: Log your activities and rate your mood (1-10) for each hour over a week. Identify which activities (even small ones like a shower or a song) slightly improve your mood.

Break the Withdrawal Cycle: Low mood -> don't act -> less activity -> worse mood. Consciously break this cycle. Even with no motivation, pre-commit to a known mildly pleasant activity (e.g., a 10-min walk).

Building Daily Rituals:

Morning Routine: Make your bed, open curtains, drink water, stretch for 5 mins. These small wins set a positive tone.

Evening Gratitude Practice: Write down 3 small good things that happened today ("sun was out," "good food at cafeteria," "friend sent a funny meme"). Redirects the brain to the positive.

When to Seek Professional Help (Red Flags):

Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, for over 2 weeks.

Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities.

Significant unintentional weight change or sleep disturbance (insomnia/hypersomnia).

Diminished ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions.

Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.

If the last point is present, contact your university counseling center, a 24/7 crisis line, or go to the emergency room immediately.
