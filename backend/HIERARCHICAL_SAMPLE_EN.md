Student Mental Health Handbook

0. Overview
This handbook provides practical guidance for students to care for their mental health. It explains common challenges, quick coping techniques, and when to seek professional help. Each section is short and actionable so it works well on mobile.

1. Understanding Emotions
Emotions are signals, not problems. Recognizing early signs helps you respond before stress escalates.

1.1 Anxiety
Anxiety shows up as worry, restlessness, muscle tension, and difficulty sleeping. Short-term coping skills include slow breathing, grounding, labeling thoughts, and brief movement breaks.

1.1.1 Signs
- Racing thoughts and difficulty focusing.
- Sensation of pressure in the chest or stomach.
- Urge to avoid tasks or situations.

1.1.2 Quick Skills
- 4-4-6 breathing (inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 6s) for 10 cycles.
- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding (notice 5 sights, 4 sounds, 3 touches, 2 smells, 1 taste).
- Write down worries, then mark which ones you can act on today.

1.2 Low Mood
Low mood often brings loss of energy, reduced motivation, and negative self-talk. Gentle activation is the most reliable antidote.

1.2.1 Activation Steps
- Choose a 10-minute task that slightly improves your day (shower, open window, short walk).
- Text one supportive person and share one sentence about how you feel.
- Prepare a low-effort meal or drink a glass of water.

1.2.2 When to Seek Help
- Low mood lasts most days for 2+ weeks.
- Sleep or appetite changes significantly.
- Thoughts of self-harm. Reach out immediately to crisis services.

2. Study & Stress Management
Academic pressure is common. Systems reduce decision fatigue and prevent last-minute surges.

2.1 Time Management
Use a light but repeatable workflow.

2.1.1 Daily Flow
1) Pick three priority tasks (max 90 minutes each).
2) Work in 25–30 minute focus blocks followed by 5–10 minute breaks.
3) End the day by scheduling the first task for tomorrow.

2.1.2 Break Design
- Move your body: stand, stretch, walk to the window.
- Switch sensory channel: look far, listen to music, drink water.
- Avoid doom-scrolling; set a timer if you open social apps.

2.2 Exam Toolkit
Create a small, portable kit you can use in 3 minutes.

2.2.1 Before the Exam
- Square breathing for one minute.
- Read top two summary cards (formulas, key ideas).
- One positive cue: "I can attempt the next question."

2.2.2 During the Exam
- If stuck for 60–90 seconds, mark and move. Return later.
- Start with items you know to build momentum.
- Use margin notes to park intrusive ideas.

3. Sleep Health
Sleep supports memory, emotion regulation, and immune function.

3.1 Evening Routine
- Dim lights 60 minutes before bed.
- Stop caffeine 8 hours before bedtime.
- Put phone on charge outside the bedroom or enable a focus profile.

3.2 If You Cannot Sleep
- Get out of bed after ~20 minutes; do a quiet activity in low light.
- Try a short body scan or slow breathing.
- Return to bed when sleepy, not by the clock.

4. Relationships & Support
Supportive connections buffer stress and increase resilience.

4.1 Communication
- Use "I-statements": "I feel overwhelmed; I need 20 minutes to finish this."
- Ask, then agree on a time to talk.
- Validate ("That sounds tough.") before offering solutions.

4.2 Building Your Support Map
- List: one peer, one family member, one staff or mentor, one professional service.
- Save numbers and office hours in your phone.
- Join one low-effort community activity per week.

5. Crisis & Safety
If you are at risk of harm or unable to care for yourself, seek urgent support.

5.1 Immediate Steps
- Contact local emergency services or campus security.
- Call a crisis line; in many regions it operates 24/7.
- Stay with someone you trust until you feel safe.

5.2 Safety Plan Snapshot
- Warning signs I notice:
- People I can call:
- Places that help me calm:
- Reasons to stay:
